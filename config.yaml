## Reduce number of threads if desired.
## Used for generating repeat genome index and performing HISAT2 alignment
threads: 16 

## Maximum number of reported alignments to repeatmasker genome
## Increasing max_k may also increase time required to process read counts.
## NOTE: k>1 will result in read counts being fractionated between the repeats to which the read was aligned.
